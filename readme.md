# ðŸ—“ Daily work scheduler
This is a simple daily planner application built using JavaScript, jQuery and Moment.js. 
The application displays the current day and time at the top of the page and allows the user to input and save events for each hour of the day. The planner also color codes each hour block to indicate whether the hour has passed, is current or is yet to come.

## Code Structure
The code is structured into three main functions:

* colorChange() function - This function iterates over the elements with class "input" and assigns the class 'past','present' or 'future' based on the comparison between the current time and the schedule time.
* renderText() function - This function is responsible for displaying the events saved in local storage when the page is loaded.
* saveBtn button functionality - When user click on the save button, it will take the text entered by user and time from the html and save the text entered by user in local storage.
